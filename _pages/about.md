Hi, I am Yadi Yang and I am currently doing my PhD in the Department of Business Economics at Erasmus University Rotterdam in the Netherlands. 

Before my PhD starts, I obtained my bachelor and master degree in Aerospace Engineering at Beijing Institute of Technology. My previous work focused on orbit design and control in binary asteroid system for spacecrafts in the Deep Space Exploration missions.

Now I move closer to the ground -- my current research is about individual decision-making in the pension field and I try to find tools that can promote and support individual pension investment for retirement. 

If you ask me: why do I turn my focus from asteroids in outer space to pension system on earth? 

Well, I think "figuring out how to motivate people save more for their retirements" is equally important to "exploring the deep space and figuring out how to send humans live on Mars or other planets".  Moreover, since aging is inevitable for everyone, comparing to "try to find the origin (or future) of our solar system and human kind", "try to help individuals make responsible pension investment decisions" is more urgent, isn't it? =)
