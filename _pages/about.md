Hi, I am Yadi Yang and I am currently doing my PhD in Department of Business and Economics at Erasmus University Rotterdam in the Netherlands. 

Before my PhD starts, I was an aerospace engineer and I did some trivial researches on deep space exploration. To put it more specifically, I studied orbit determination for Near-Earth-Orbit (NEO) satellites, navigation and control of spacecrafts, orbit dynamics in the vicinity of asteroids (specially binary asteroids). My master graduation project is about the Design and Control of Resonant Trajectory in Binary Asteroid System. Sound quite far away from earth, right?

If you ask me: why do I turn my focus on outer space into pension system on earth? What's in common between "figuring out how to send humans live on Mars" and "figuring out how to motivate people save more for their retirements"? 

The aswer is: Welfare.

This is why now I am back on earth: my research focuses on  Individual Risk Preference Elicitation and Communication in Pension Field. Since aging is inevitable for everyone and the population aged 65 and over is growing faster than all other age groups globally, how to get more people involved in Pension scheme and how to promote and support individual's investment and saving behavior will be essential for every one in every country.
