In this course, I teach master students how to identify variables and variable types in a given marketing problem, select the appropriate statistical method for a given marketing problem, apply statistical methods to real-life data sets with the help of SPSS. 

The students are expected to be able to interpret statistical results in the applied aspects of various research techniques unique to marketing data, and use marketing research to aid to managerial decision making.
