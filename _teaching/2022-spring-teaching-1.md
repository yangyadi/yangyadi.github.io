In this course, I teach master students how to solve marketing case study using RStudio in 7 weeks. Each week, the case questions are related to a specific methodology and analysis that is often used in conjunction with the topic of that week, e.g., customer segmentation, customer acquisition, search analytics and advertising, etc. 

The objective of the course is to provide an introduction to marketing strategy and analytics for econometrics students, and demonstrate the benefits of using a systematic and analytic approach to strategic decision-making in marketing.
